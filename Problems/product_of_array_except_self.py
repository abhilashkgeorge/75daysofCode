# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] 
# is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) t
# ime and without using the division operation.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
# Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

        #Note: using the division operator ,Which was clearly not allowed from the question.
        # answers: int = 1
        # for value in nums:
        #     answers = value * answers
        # answer:List[int] = []

        #     answer.insert(i,int(answers/nums[i]))

        #     print(answer)

# This is complex why do it this way I have no clue yet but seems reasonable but chatGPT explained the solution way better to me than these youtube channel solution 
# I really need to learn to solve all these problems myself , planning on starting a startup fed up of sitting still in a company I want to use my resources to its full potential.

        # left_prod = []
        # right_prod = []
        # left_prod.insert(0,1)
        # right_prod.insert(len(nums)-1,1)

        # for i in range(1,len(nums)):

# THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION

        # Create a new array to store the result
        result = []
        
        # Loop through the input array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Initialize a variable to store the product
            # Set it to 1 initially to account for the fact
            # that we will be multiplying the elements together
            product = 1
            
            # Loop through the array again, excluding the current element
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                if i != j:
                    # Multiply the current element with the product
                    product *= nums[j]
            
            # Append the product to the result array
            result.append(product)
        
        # Return the result array
        return result
